The Global Peace Index (GPI) was created by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), a think tank with a dedication to measuring positive human well-being and progress, and is one attempt to quantitatively measure the relative position of a nations' and regions' peacefulness. The official 2017 report visualizes the most recent data as a map below: 
![GPI map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/GPI_2017.jpg)

Today I will web scrape the GPI data from **2008** to **2017** from Wikipedia using the `rvest` package and use a variety of data tidying packages such as `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `stringr` to create a **bump chart** to visualize the GPI index data in another way!

```{r }
# Global Peace Index
library(tidyverse)          # includes dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2
library(scales)             # more options for scales on plots
library(ggrepel)            # dealing with overlapping text/labels
library(rvest)              # for web scraping: read_html(), html_table() functions
library(stringr)            # dealing with strings
library(forcats)            # change factor levels manually

# Web scrape: -------------------------------------------------------------

url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Peace_Index"

GPI <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes('table.wikitable:nth-child(29)') %>%
  .[[1]] %>% 
  html_table()

# 12/1/17: update css selector to table.wikitable:nth-child(77)

GPI <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes('table.wikitable:nth-child(77)') %>%
  .[[1]] %>% 
  html_table(header = TRUE)

write.csv(GPI, "~/R_materials/global_peace_index/GPI_raw.csv")

GPI <- read.csv("~/R_materials/global_peace_index/GPI_raw.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```

Here we use the `read_html()` function to read the url of the web page, then we find the **CSS selector** of the table we want to use from the web page. 
I will go through what I did above step-by-step (Using the Mozilla Firefox browser):

1. Press **F12** or **Ctrl + Shift + C** to open up the *Inspector Tool* on the page you want to extract data from
2. Click on the left-most button the pop-up bar
3. Hover your mouse over the element of the page you want to extract. The console will scroll to the exact html code that you are point at
4. Right-click on the highlighted html code, click on 'Copy' in the menu, then click on 'CSS Selector'
5. Then Paste into R and place it inside the `html_nodes()` function as above within brackets.
6. Select only the element with the table information (in this case there is only one element anyways), `[[1]]`.
7. Finally we specifically extract the table using `html_table()`. You can use the `fill = ` option to autofill any poorly formatted tables. 

Now with our data gathered, let's take a closer inspection at what we have: 

```{r}
# Inspect scraped data ----------------------------------------------------

glimpse(GPI)

```

For my purposes I only need the data from the `rank` variables so I create a new dataframe excluding the `score` columns. A neat trick here is to use the `ends_with()` function inside `select()` to select all the variables that end in **"rank"**, much easier than manually inputting every single **"rank"** column!

```{r}
# Tidy dataset ------------------------------------------------------------

GPI_rank <- GPI %>% select(Country, ends_with("rank"))

colnames(GPI_rank) <- colnames(GPI_rank) %>% tolower()   # turn "Country" into lower case...

glimpse(GPI_rank)

```

In data analysis, one of the most important part of the process is the data cleaning (also called data tidying or data munging) process that we have been doing here. One of the main tenets of the cleaning process is to have a _tidy_ dataset where we arrange data so that each *variable* is a **column** and each *observation* is a **row**.

We see that the data we have is organized in an _"untidy"_ or _"wide"_ format. To make our analysis workflow smoother we need to convert this data frame into the _tidy_ or _"long"_ format. We do this by using the `gather()` function in the `tidyr` package. For more details on the concept of "**tidy data**" Hadley Wickham's seminal paper on this subject can be found [here](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf).

```{r}
GPI_rank <- GPI_rank %>% gather(`2017 rank`:`2008 rank`, key = "year", value = "rank")

glimpse(GPI_rank)

```

Next, in the `year` column let's take out the "rank" part of each "20xx rank" value (basically changing the values from '2017 rank' to '2017'). We can do this by using the `str_replace_all()` function from the `stringr` package to specifically take out "rank", and then clean up the remaining white space with `trimws()`.

```{r}
GPI_rank$year <- GPI_rank$year %>% str_replace_all("rank", "") %>% trimws()

glimpse(GPI_rank)

```

Now we can turn the `year` column into a **factor** variable:

```{r}
GPI_rank <- GPI_rank %>% mutate(year = as.factor(year))
levels(GPI_rank$year)     # now as factor + no "rank" afterwards.

```

Let's inspect our work so far!

```{r}
GPI_rank %>% head(15)

```

We can see here that there are countries with a tied ranking due to similar GPI scores (shown in original GPI table), first let's get rid of the `=` symbol:

```{r}
GPI_rank <- GPI_rank %>% mutate(rank = str_replace(rank, "\\=", ""))   #   take out '=' in rank values

```

Now let's change the `rank` variable into a **numeric** format and finally reorder the dataframe so that the rows are arranged in a way where ranks are in ascending order for each year (2008: Rank #1 - #163, 2009: Rank #1 - #163, etc.).

```{r}
GPI_rank$rank <- as.numeric(GPI_rank$rank)

GPI_rank <- GPI_rank %>% arrange(year, rank)

glimpse(GPI_rank)

```

## Dealing with tied rank values!

BIG EDIT: Months later, I realized that I can just use the `ties.method =` argument in the `rank()` function... so simple and so obvious, doh!

(I deleted most of this section where I manually replaced some of the tied values but kept the detecing duplicates bit - the first part of the code below - as that can still be of some use!)

```{r}
###################################################################################################

GPI_rank %>% 
  filter(year == 2017) %>%       # replace 2017 with each specific year...
  select(rank) %>%  
  duplicated() %>%               # find duplicate values: TRUE/FALSE
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column() %>% 
  filter(. == TRUE)

###################################################################################################

GPI_rank[1551:1552, 1:3]   # Bangladesh and Bosnia & Herzegovina are tied 84th in 2017!

GPI_rank %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  mutate(rank = rank(rank, ties.method = "first")) %>% 
  filter(year == 2017) %>% 
  slice(84:85)             # Bangladesh is 84th and Bosnia & Herzegovina is now 85th! Success!

GPI_rank <- GPI_rank %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  mutate(rank = rank(rank, ties.method = "first"))

```

Now ALL the tied ranks are fixed with the second tied rank value taking on a `n+1` rank value instead!

Now let's create a **custom ggplot theme** that we can add on to our plot and call it... `theme_peace`!

```{r}
# Create custom theme -----------------------------------------------------
library(extrafont)                 # for fonts in titles and labels

theme_peace <-  
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Garamond", color = "#444444", face = "bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 24, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5, margin = margin(r = 15)),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 20)),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none")

```

The type of plot we are going to create is called a **bump chart** which are used to visualize changes in rank over periods of time, which is perfect for our current analysis!
Here let's specifically highlight the ranking over time for Japan by coloring its line to red and making the other countries more transparent by creating an `if/else` statement that evaluates whether the country being plotted is Japan or not. Also by using `geom_text` we can manually add labels next to both the `2008` and `2017` variables:

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=8, fig.align='center'}
# Plotting ----------------------------------------------------------------

GPI_rank %>% 
  filter(rank <= 10) %>% 
  mutate(jpn = ifelse(country == "Japan", T, F)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, rank, group = country)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = jpn, alpha = jpn), size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(color = jpn, alpha = jpn), size = 2.3) +
  geom_text(data = GPI_rank %>% filter(year == "2008", rank <= 10), 
            aes(label = country, x = "2008"), color = "black", size = 4, nudge_x = -1.5) +
  geom_text(data = GPI_rank %>% filter(year == "2017", rank <= 10), 
            aes(label = country, x = "2017"), color = "black", size = 4, nudge_x = 1.5) +
  scale_y_reverse(breaks = pretty_breaks(10)) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0.15, 0.1)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#104E8B", "#EE2C2C")) + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Rank") +
  ggtitle("Global Peace Index (Top 10)", subtitle = "(2008-2017)") +
  theme_peace

```

We can clearly see that Japan's ranking has fallen from 2008 and even dropping out of the Top 10 altogether in 2017 (*Note*: technically Ireland and Japan were tied for 10th in 2017)! Could this be a result of the rising tensions in the past 10 years with its neighbors on a number of issues, such as the [East China Sea disputes](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2017/08/29/commentary/japan-commentary/japans-maritime-diplomacy-mission-s-e-asia/), the more recent protests regarding the [comfort women issue](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/world/asia/japan-ambassador-south-korea-comfort-woman.html), and of course North Korea's recent [missile tests](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-41281050) among others? Let's see if there is a general downward trend in the East Asia region between 2008 and 2017! Neither `Macau` or `Hong Kong` are in the data as they are counted as dependent territories and from what we know of recent conflicts in the *"marginal seas"* of the Pacific we include ASEAN contries such as Vietnam and the Philippines.  

```{r}
# Subset custom "East Asia" region -----------------------------------------------

GPI_Asia <- GPI_rank %>% filter(country %in% c("Japan", "China", "Korea Republic", "DPR Korea", 
                                               "Philippines", "Taiwan", "Vietnam")) %>% 
  mutate(region = "East Asia")

glimpse(GPI_Asia)
GPI_Asia$rank <- as.numeric(GPI_Asia$rank)


```

Now we are all ready to start plotting!

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=8, fig.align='center'}
# Plot "East Asia" region -------------------------------------------------
GPI_Asia %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, as.numeric(rank), group = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(data = GPI_Asia %>% filter(year == "2008"), 
                  aes(label = country, x = "2008"), color = "black", size = 4, nudge_x = -1.1) +
  geom_text(data = GPI_Asia %>% filter(year == "2017"), 
                  aes(label = country, x = "2017"), color = "black", size = 4, nudge_x = 1.1) +
  scale_y_reverse(breaks = c(1, 5, seq(10, 160, by = 10))) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0.1, 0.05)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Rank") +
  ggtitle("Global Peace Index (East Asia Region)\n (2008-2017)") +
  theme_peace

```

There could still be some improvements made to this plot, specifically, the country labels on either side of the x-axis limits. We can fix this by Using the `gg_repel` package that will spread them out and create a small line/arrow from the label box pointing to the corresponding line or point. We can also manually set colors to each of our custom "East Asia" region countries to further differntiate each line and make it more easy to read:

```{r}
# plot with filter()  East Asia

colors = c(
  Japan = "#EE2C2C",          # red
  S.Korea = "#0c2c84",        # dark blue
  China = "#00441b",          # green
  N.Korea = "#4a1486",        # purple
  Vietnam = "#636363",        # dark grey
  Philippines = "#fd8d3c",    # orange
  Taiwan = "#000000"          # black
)
```

Change the variable type of `country` into a **factor** and then rename _Korea Republic_ to _S.Korea_ and _DPR Korea_ to _N.Korea_ to fit graph labels better:

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=8, fig.align='center'}
# rename Korea Republic to S.Korea to fit graph label better...
GPI_Asia$country <- as.factor(GPI_Asia$country)
GPI_Asia %>% glimpse()

GPI_Asia <- GPI_Asia %>% 
   mutate(country = fct_recode(country,
                                 "S.Korea" = "Korea Republic",
                                 "N.Korea" = "DPR Korea"))

# use geom_text_repel() instead of regular geom_text() as doesnt have font-face for some stupid reason -_-"

GPI_Asia %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, as.numeric(rank), group = country)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = country)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = country)) +
  geom_label_repel(data = GPI_Asia %>% filter(year == "2008"), 
                  aes(label = country, x = "2008"), 
                  color = "black", size = 3.5, nudge_x = -0.9, 
                  fontface = "bold", segment.colour = "red") +
  geom_label_repel(data = GPI_Asia %>% filter(year == "2017"), 
                   aes(label = country, x = "2017"), 
                   color = "black", size = 3.5, nudge_x = 1.5,
                   fontface = "bold", segment.colour = "red") +
  scale_y_reverse(breaks = c(1, 5, seq(10, 160, by = 10))) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0.2, 0.05)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Rank") +
  ggtitle("Global Peace Index (East Asia Region)\n (2008-2017)") +
  theme_peace +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors)

```

Of course, the changes in rankings aren't **_all_** due to inter-country conflicts as it is only 1 of the 23 indicators used to calculate the GPI score. Both external peace indicators (*military expenditure as a percentage of GDP*, _nuclear and heavey weapons capabilities_, and _relations with neighboring countries_) **and** internal peace indicators (*level of violent crime*, _political instability_, _impact of terrorism_) are used in calculating the GPI. The full run-down on the various indicators can be found in Appendix B of the most recent GPI Report [here](http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI17-Report.pdf).  
There is another way to do the above but first I'll clean up the data further by changing the names of the Koreas in the main dataset like we did in `GPI_Asia`:

```{r}
GPI_rank <- GPI_rank %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_recode(country,
                              "S.Korea" = "Korea Republic",
                              "N.Korea" = "DPR Korea"))

```

Instead of creating new subset of our data, we can reduce clutter in our R environment by using `magrittr` pipes before plotting!

To do the same thing without creating a separate dataset (like `GPI_Asia`) is to simply create a new variable called `region` inside our existing `GPI_rank` data frame and then use the `filter()` function right before we pipe it through our `ggplot` code: 

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=8, fig.align='center'}
# Piping before plotting East Asia ----------------------------------------

GPI_rank <- GPI_rank %>% 
      mutate(region = if_else(country %in% c("Japan", "China", "S.Korea", "N.Korea", "Philippines", "Taiwan", "Vietnam"), "East Asia", "Other")) 

# Final plot: East Asia ---------------------------------------------------

GPI_rank %>%
  filter(region == "East Asia") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, rank, group = country)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = country), size = 1.2, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_point(aes(color = country), size = 1.1, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = GPI_rank %>% 
      filter(year == "2008", region == "East Asia"), 
      aes(label = country, x = "2008"), 
      color = "black", family = "Times New Roman", fontface = "bold",
      size = 4, nudge_x = -0.9) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = GPI_rank %>% 
      filter(year == "2017", region == "East Asia"), 
      aes(label = country, x = "2017"), 
      color = "black", family = "Century", fontface = "bold",
      size = 4, nudge_x = 0.9) +
  scale_y_reverse(breaks = c(1, seq(10, 160, by = 10))) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0.2, 0.05)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Rank") +
  ggtitle("Global Peace Index (East Asia Region)\n (2008-2017)") +
  theme_peace +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors)

```

With the colored lines and the labels we can clearly see the downward trend of GPI rankings for all countries in the East Asia region. The exception is Taiwan which although shown as 37th in 2008, it was technically tied with Tunisia and South Korea, so they reverted back to their 2008 rank following a brief rise.  

Hopefully with initiatives like the GPI and the works of other peace-oriented think tanks, the public can identify different sources of problems that hinder peaceful co-existence both within-countries and between-countries and assist policy-makers in finding viable solutions!
